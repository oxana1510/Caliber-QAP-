					<h2>QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM 101</h2>
					<p>The Quality Assurance Program (QAP) manages risks that may occur during the installation of spray foam. The QAP provides a clear framework to deliver assurance that spray foam meet defined quality expectations and is installed in conformance with applicable standards and manufacturer requirements. Fundamentally, the QAP is in place to provide confidence regarding the quality of installation in the field. Done right the first time and everytime is our goal. The QAP encompasses a variety of actions that include training and education, objective qualification of contractors and installers, a tool for installers QA/QC self check, a documentation process to create records, access to an independent auditor to conduct compliance audits , and a process to deal with the problem installations.</p>
